## Structured Facts

### Agent Rules
- [critical] Agent 3 Reviewer must use GSD discipline (FORBIDDEN: Approve without independent validation or skip runtime proof) (REQUIRED: Run GSD checks, verify source/runtime truth, run independent validation)
- [critical] Agent 3 must verify fresh :5180 runtime for UI/runtime work (FORBIDDEN: Review UI/runtime contour without verifying the runtime is actually serving) (REQUIRED: curl -I http://clearvestnic.ru:5180 and confirm HTTP 200 with no-cache headers)
- [high] Agent 3 must test the exact user scenario (FORBIDDEN: Substitute a different scenario or skip the exact reproduction steps) (REQUIRED: Reproduce the exact steps described in the contour PLAN.md acceptance criteria)
- [critical] Diagram performance review must test real mouse drag, not only programmatic zoom/click (FORBIDDEN: Approve based only on synthetic zoom, click, or programmatic tests without real drag) (REQUIRED: Perform actual pointer drag on the BPMN canvas and observe jank/frame drops)
- [high] No product runtime code changes in RAG tooling contours (FORBIDDEN: Modify frontend/src/, backend/app/, or any product runtime file during RAG work) (REQUIRED: Keep changes under tools/rag/, docs/rag/, .planning/contours/ only)
- [critical] Agent 1 Planner must use GSD discipline (FORBIDDEN: Skip planning documentation or proceed without bounded scope) (REQUIRED: Run GSD checks, create PLAN.md, define acceptance criteria, write STATE.json)
- [critical] RAG is read-only suggestion/context layer (FORBIDDEN: Auto-mututate code, auto-save files, write BPMN XML, or apply Product Actions automatically based on RAG output) (REQUIRED: Treat RAG results as suggestions, warnings, and references only)

### User Rejections
- [high] fix/diagram-drag-lag-gsd-review-version-ledger-rework-v1: Formal REVIEW_PASS focused on review process and version ledger, not on actual drag performance fix. → Decompose the engine and address React re-render cost during drag; do not approve based on synthetic tests only.
- [critical] perf/diagram-modeler-drag-hot-path-and-pointermove-suppression-v1: Formal REVIEW_PASS did not correspond to user-visible drag lag resolution. → Investigate React bundle cost rather than only event handler batching; establish real drag baseline with profiler.
- [high] fix/diagram-real-drag-performance-and-engine-decomposition-v1: Formal REVIEW_PASS was granted but user later reported remaining issues with large-canvas lag and version marker overlay. → Relocate version marker off canvas and implement viewer-first design for large canvases.
- [critical] perf/diagram-modeler-drag-hot-path-and-pointermove-suppression-v1: Reviewer tested synthetic zoom/click instead of real mouse drag. → All diagram performance reviews must include real mouse drag test with profiler or frame-time evidence.
- [medium] fix/diagram-real-drag-performance-and-engine-decomposition-v1: Version marker was placed on the BPMN canvas, interfering with diagram interaction. → Move version marker to a non-canvas UI element (e.g., header bar, badge, footer).

## Warnings
- ⚠️ User rejection ur-fix-drag-ledger-rework overrides formal REVIEW_PASS for fix/diagram-drag-lag-gsd-review-version-ledger-rework-v1: Formal REVIEW_PASS focused on review process and version ledger, not on actual drag performance fix.
- ⚠️ User rejection ur-perf-drag-hot-path overrides formal REVIEW_PASS for perf/diagram-modeler-drag-hot-path-and-pointermove-suppression-v1: Formal REVIEW_PASS did not correspond to user-visible drag lag resolution.
- ⚠️ User rejection ur-fix-real-drag-engine overrides formal REVIEW_PASS for fix/diagram-real-drag-performance-and-engine-decomposition-v1: Formal REVIEW_PASS was granted but user later reported remaining issues with large-canvas lag and version marker overlay.
- ⚠️ User rejection ur-synthetic-zoom-not-drag overrides formal REVIEW_PASS for perf/diagram-modeler-drag-hot-path-and-pointermove-suppression-v1: Reviewer tested synthetic zoom/click instead of real mouse drag.
- ⚠️ User rejection ur-version-marker-on-canvas overrides formal REVIEW_PASS for fix/diagram-real-drag-performance-and-engine-decomposition-v1: Version marker was placed on the BPMN canvas, interfering with diagram interaction.
- ⚠️ No runtime facts matched query — runtime proof may be missing.
- ⚠️ REMINDER: Do not print secrets. Preflight output may contain paths but not credentials.
